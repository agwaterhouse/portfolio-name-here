<h2>The Problem </h2>


<p>The time is ticking to save the planet with top scientists estimating that we have got less than 18 months to save the earth <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48964736">(BBC News, 2019).</a> This means every individual, organisation and industry must come together to reduce their environmental footprint and the music industry is not exempt from this. The music industry is a huge problem for the planet, with private jets taking bands across the world and fans traveling miles to see them, combined with the tonnes of plastic generated by venues and festivals, which will end up in landfill. The music industry in the United Kingdom has recently declared a ‘climate and ecological emergency’ <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/uk-music-industry-declares-climate-and-ecological-emergency/076773">(Music Week, 2019).</a></p>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<p>The group used Crazy 8’s as a design sprint method, which helped develop ideas on how this climate problem could be solved. A couple of themes started to appear from Crazy 8’s, such as Reforestation and the development of an app. The group established that a prototype could be developed that allowed users to purchase their concert tickets for live events, and then give back to the planet by planting a tree on a map. The cost of planting the tree could be paid for by the users booking fee.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Secondary research was conducted to discover if there was a demand for the product, and to understand the user needs. The group looked at research published by <a href="https://discover.ticketmaster.co.uk/festivals/sustainability-44889/">(Ticket Master, no date)</a> which outlined how festival attendees would like to reduce their environmental impact. The research identified the top 5 most important sustainable initiatives at festivals. Number 4 on the list identifies the use of digital instead of paper tickets, this feature was incorporated into Treekits.</p>



<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>User research enabled the group to determine pain points for different users, and to understand the frustrations they might have while using the app. It was conducted as there was not enough secondary research available that outlined how resistant users would be to swapping to a different ticketing app.</p>

<p>An Online Survey was created to achieve a wider understanding of Treekits target audience and user requirements. This involved distributing the survey to a wide range of potential users. Allowing the group to understand users perceptions of the most important features of ticketing apps, and their willingness to switch to Treekits.</p>

<h2>User Research Findings</h2>

<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>All users consider themselves to take ‘some’ or more consideration of the environment in their everyday lives <strong class="active">(100%).</strong></li>
    <li>Most users are not using an app that helps the environment when purchasing tickets <strong class="active">(76.2%).</strong></li>
    <li>Users agree they would be prepared to change the app they use if it supports the environment <strong class="active">(90.5%).</strong> </li>
</ul>

<h2>Personas</h2>
<p>Personas allowed the group to get a representation of potential product users and their needs and goals. They were based on the teams user research which identified the type of users that would be using Treekits.  The personas allowed the group to examine the frustrations and needs that these individuals would have, and influenced the groups design choices.

<h2>Sketches</h2>

<p>Sketches were produced to show the flow of the user interface from one screen to another. Sketching allowed the group to ‘rapidly iterate’ and quickly throw away bad ideas. They also allowed the group to explore different possibilities and discover innovative ways to display content.</p>

<p>The best sketches were shared with users to get audience insight at an early stage. Comments made about these initial designs are included in the annotations, these comments influenced the development of the prototype. </p>

<h2>User Journey</h2>

<p>The user journey helped identify potential pain points and needs from the user at different parts of the process. The groups user journey explored the experience a user would have to go through to buy a ticket and plant a tree on the app.</p>

<h2>Usability Testing</h2>

<p>I facilitated user testing of the initial Treekits Prototype and used screen and audio capturing equipment to analyse the results of this testing. Other members of my team were responsible for recording error rates and timings of the individual tasks which I asked users to complete. A list of the tasks users were to complete can be seen below: </p>

  
 <ol class="numbered">
    <li>Find “The 1975” concert page.</li>
    <li>Can you find a way to add this band to your favourites?</li>
    <li>Select three standing tickets for “The 1975” concert on the 27th of December in Skegness.</li>
    <li>Can you pay for the tickets using your Debit Card?</li>
    <li>Plant a tree in an area in Scotland that is in desperate need of reforestation.</li>
    <li>Through the app, share about your planted tree with your friends on Facebook, using a personalised message.</li>
    <li>Can you navigate back to the homepage?</li>
</ol>



<h2>Key Findings and What This Meant For Our Design</h2>
<ul class="bulleted">
    <li>Users struggled to find a call to action button on the search bar. 
    <strong class="active">A button labelled ‘Search’ was added in the final iteration to make this more obvious to users.</strong></li>

    <li>Input boxes caused the users frustration as they had to delete filler text in every box. Especially time consuming on the payment page with many fields. <strong class="active">Introduced placeholder text in the final iteration where the text disappears when the users begins to type.</strong></li>

    <li>Users do not always know the format of the data they are inputting, for example they don’t know how to input an expiry date. <strong class="active">Introduced validation on fields such as expiry dates, using two drop down menus for both the month and year.</strong></li>

    <li>Too many fields and too much information on a page is confusing for users. <strong class="active">The payment page was split into 2 sections in the final iteration to simplify the content.</strong></li>

    <li>The interactivity of the map was not obvious to some users, as they couldn’t establish how to share on Facebook. <strong class="active">In the final iteration, short text animations were animated onto the screen to walk the user through how to use the map.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Prototype</h2>
<p>I went on to develop a prototype based on all our findings from our usability testing. I analysed the different pain points for users and incorporated this into the redesign. <a href="https://7iok5x.axshare.com/#id=reihdy&p=home">The final prototype is available here.</a></p>
