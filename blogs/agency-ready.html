<h2>Auto Trader Meetup</h2>





<p>Monolith’s, Micro services, Routing proxies, Redux, Boilerplate code, Graph GL, Node JS, sound familiar? Great I’m sure you’re an accomplished Web Developer but hearing all this terminology at a recent <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/building-auto-traders-consumer-website-tickets-71643990103?aff=eemailordconf&utm_campaign=order_confirm&utm_medium=email&ref=eemailordconf&utm_source=eventbrite&utm_term=viewevent">Auto Trader meet up</a> made me think about the gap between what the industry needs, and what sort of web-development graduates universities are producing.</p> 

<h2>Are we learning the right things?</h2>

<p>60% of the web development industry believe that the current curriculum doesn’t meet industry needs <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019">(Manchester Digital Skills, 2019)</a> and after attending the Auto Trader event in September and feeling very out of my depth, I started to think that this might be true. On a personal level looking at what key concepts and programming languages my course teaches compared to what <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019">(Manchester Digital Skills, 2019)</a> audit state as the most used in the industry, also primarily raised some alarms. The audit states that the top 5 most used programming languages as PHP, Java script, Java, C# and HTML. I don’t wish to pursue a career in Software Development so the appearance of Java and C# in the list aren’t a major concern, however out of other 3 languages predominantly used for web, HTML is the only language which I feel has been taught in depth in my degree.</p>

<h2>Industry Input?</h2>

<p>In 2018 digital technology investment increased by 288% on 2017 figures reaching a record high figure of £153 billion <a href="https://technation.io/report2019">(Tech Nation, 2019)</a>. The industry has continued to grow, however if some of this investment isn’t pumped into producing the next generation of developers, where will the industry be in 20 years time? The Future of Jobs report <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">(The World Economic Forum, 2018)</a> says that 74% of companies surveyed already believe that a skills gap could be a barrier to them investing in and using new technology. This investment doesn’t need to be financial it could just be time, talking to students and lecturer’s about what they want from graduates, 63% of people in the industry believe that there isn’t currently enough industry intervention <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019">(Manchester Digital Skills, 2019)</a>. Therefore, in order to bridge this skill gap and meet the industry needs, I believe that more industry intervention and input is needed.</p>

<h2>Are all students doomed?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/how-being-in-a-band-taught-me-to-be-a-better-web-designer/">(Girard ,2015)</a> Blog post in Smashing magazine on How Being In A Band Taught Me To Be A Better Web Designer made me rethink that maybe what we learn in the classroom really isn’t that far away from what the industry needs. Girard talks of how soft skills are often just as useful such as teamwork, confidence and commercial awareness are just as important as hard skills like knowing different programming languages. I believe universality certainly does prepare you for these aspects of the industry, with commercial awareness and team work being worked on from day 1 in first year with units that help you understand how businesses operate and communicate with the wider world.</p>

<h2>Is it just another phase?</h2>

<p>It is also important to look at the life span of a lot of these languages currently being used, React and other such languages won’t be around forever, however the fundamentals will. Just take Flash for an example, a few years ago web developers were constantly making Flash based applications, whereas now the only talk of Flash in the industry is how to convert your old Flash applications in to something else such as HTML5 <a href="https://turbofuture.com/computers/The-End-of-Flash-in-2020-Converting-From-Flash-to-HTML5">(Griggs, 2019)</a>. Having a good understanding of HTML and CSS and how the industry works is vital and that isn’t going to change any time soon.</p>

<h2>Agency Ready?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/bsc-digital-media-and-communications/">My Digital Media course</a> constantly produces web developers, that are now working with languages such as PHP and Java which are never really explored in our 3 years at university. Learning the correct practices and principles that underline all these languages when developing for web, for example accessibility appears to be just as important for employers than learning the basics of a language which can be quickly picked up while coding 8 hours a day on the job.</p>


<p>In conclusion, I think Web Development courses teach what the industry needs and not necessarily want it wants.  There are companies out there that will employ developers based purely on the fact that they know the current languages being used by the business. However, in 2 years time this language could become obsolete and so could that ‘developer’, when inevitably the language is replaced in a vicious cycle of new technology.  I want to become a developer, but I don’t want to become a developer that relies on a framework or platform to produce a simple web page or application and I believe my agency ready class las led to me being ‘ready’ to compete in the industry.</p>
