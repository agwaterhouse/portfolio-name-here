		<h4>Business owner and founder:</h4>
		<p>Small animal care is my own business that I started when I finished my GCSE’s in 2015. This involves caring for client’s pets in my home and communicating with new and existing clients in person, over the phone and through email. I have built an excellent reputation and brand which has led to me having many returning customers from all over Yorkshire. Part of running my business involves maintaining my website. I’m currently in the process of building a fully accessible, and responsive website for my business, conducting user research to build a site where users get the information they need to make an informed choice. </p>
